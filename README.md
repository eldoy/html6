# HTML6

HTML6 is a next-generation template language that compiles extended HTML syntax into optimized JavaScript functions for fast content rendering.

## How is it different?

It combines the familiarity of HTML with powerful features inspired by modern frameworks like `React (components)`, `VueJS (logic handling)`, and `Mustache (data binding)`, without requiring any client-side library.

## Why choose it?

It lets you write clean, maintainable templates that include control flow, data injection, and reusable components. These templates compile into efficient JavaScript functions designed for high-performance rendering.

## Features

- **Extended HTML**: Add logic with simple attributes like `if`, `elsif`, `else`, `map`.
- **Components**: Build reusable custom tags with `props` and `slots`.
- **Data Injection**: Pass all data via the `render` function.
